# linter-nvcc package

NVCC linter for Atom. Modified from [linter-clang](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-clang)

This project is in beta. I don't write javascript often (and I hate javascript), so patches are welcome.

## Project-specific settings

### .nvcc_complete

Almost same as `.clang_complete`.
